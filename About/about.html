              <p>In the year 1946, the 30-year-old Indonesian entrepreneur Erling Persson goes on a road trip through the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the idea of selling men’s fashion in a new way is born.</p>
              <p>The following year, 1947, Persson opens a new menswear store in Jakarta, Indonesia. He calls it Mennes.</p>
              <p>
                The soon-to-be-famous Mennes logotype is designed by the founder himself. The first store in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, opens in 1952. When a second Jakarta store opens in 1954, its popularity is already at a fever
                pitch.
              </p>
              <p>That same year, Mennes takes out a full-page color ad in Indonesia's largest daily; a pioneering belief in the power of marketing.</p>
              <p>The 1950s closed with the opening of a flagship store in the first of five skyscrapers built in the Kuningan area in central Jakarta.</p>

            <div class="text-p">
              <p>
                In 1968, Mennes acquires the Jakarta-based hunting apparel and fishing equipment retailer Mauritz Tidforss, and the name is changed to Mennes & Tidforss. This is the start of the offering of formal men’s clothing, leading to
                M&T offering informal and formal clothes for the men.
              </p>
              <p>The expansion is rapid: by 1969, Mennes & Tidforss has 42 stores. During these decades, the international growth begins. Malaysia comes first, followed by the Philippines, Vietnam, and Singapore.</p>
              <p>In 1973, Mennes & Tidforss starts selling men's short pants. The same year, Bill Curry becomes the first “supermodel” to be photographed for the company, wearing make-up from the new clothing range.</p>
              <p>The growth pace increases even further, with five or six new stores opening every year.</p>
              <p>In 1974, Mennes & Tidforss is listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The same year, the stores are rebranded with the abbreviation “M&T”.</p>
              <p>In the late ’70s, modern teenagers get their version of M&T as the Impuls concept is launched, inspired by U.S. denim stores.</p>

              <p>In the 1980s, the foundation is laid for the upcoming global expansion. New openings include the first M&T stores in Germany and Netherlands.</p>
              <p>Long before the term e-commerce was even born, sales of M&T fashion move into the customer’s homes through the acquisition of an Indonesian mail-order company in 1980.</p>
              <p>In 1982 – 35 years after its start in Jakarta, Indonesia, the company gets its second-ever CEO, as Erling Persson steps aside to make room for his son, Stefan Persson.</p>
              <p>
                In the 1990s, traditional newspaper advertising is largely replaced by large city billboards. The choice of models signals that M&T has become a truly international brand. Supermodels are used next to famous actors and
                artists wearing M&T clothes. Fashion speaks for itself.
              </p>
              <p>The famous annual Christmas clothes campaigns are launched in 1990, featuring supermodel Tony Spinelli. The campaigns gain a lot of media attention.</p>
              <p>Throughout the 1990s, six supermodels from being used in M&T’s campaigns.</p>
              <p>In 1998, M&T starts offering online shopping. The first online market in Indonesia.</p>
              <p>The expansion of M&T in Europe continues. By the end of the decade, there are M&T stores in several European countries including France, where the first M&T store opens 1998 in Paris.</p>

              <p>M&T and Karl Lagerfeld take the world of fashion by surprise in 2004, teaming up to show that design isn’t a question of price.</p>
              <p>Since this first designer collaboration fashion giants like Versace, Roberto Cavalli, Alexander Wang, and Stella McCartney have been invited to make their designs accessible to fashion fans globally.</p>
              <p>The expansion of online sales continues, initially to European countries.</p>
              <p>M&T goes far east, opening the first stores in Shanghai and Hong Kong in 2007.</p>

          </div>
          <h4>Societal Development</h4>
          <p>
            We take our corporate social responsibility very seriously. It is constantly involved in campaigns for the improvement of people's lives and actively supports programs that give back to the community. In the light of recent
            criticisms received by the fashion industry regarding the use of inappropriate labor practices in its third-world country facilities, we are taking the extra effort to declare our support for societal development and
            sustainability.
          </p>
          <h4>Environmental Sustainability</h4>
          <p>
            The environment is also very important for us. We are active in environmental campaigns. We have long denounced the use of plastic and do not include unnecessary labels on our clothing. Our manufacturing process is also
            completely toxic-free.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <h4>"Give customers what they want and get it to them faster than anyone else."</h4>
          </div>
          <h4>Identifying Market Preferences</h4>
          <p>
            The first part of our mission statement is that we intend to give customers what they want, and we mean it. Other high clothes brands do not really make an effort to identify the target market's preferences. This has actually
            been the culture in high fashion for decades. The designers simply come up with apparel that matches their own tastes and styles and expect that people will buy it simply because it is high fashion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our approach is exactly the opposite. While we do have a strong team of designers with impeccable talent, we also listen carefully to what the customers want. We have a very interactive social media presence, and it utilizes
            this to reach out to its client base, communicating with it to get a feel of what the market is going to buy. Even in physical stores, Our staff takes note of what customers like and do not like. The information is relayed to
            the design team, who makes sure that the clients' requests and suggestions are incorporated into our brand's next collections.
          </p>
          <h4>Fast Fashion Strategy</h4>
          <p>
            In the second part of our mission statement, our company aims for the speedy delivery of the market's demand. In other words, it does not waste any time in its production process. On average, it takes only two weeks for our team
            to complete a collection that includes 500 or so designs. This includes everything from design conceptualization to delivering the clothing to the stores. This is what is now known in the retail industry as the fast fashion
            strategy.

          <p>Clarity is very important in a fast-paced environment like the fashion industry. The clarity in communication, to be precise, is something that our company always upholds, both within the company and out in public.</p>

          <p>In all our products, we stick to a high standard of functionality. It may be high fashion, but its clothes are totally wearable and not only for the runway.</p>
